# Multiplayer snake game with alterable grid type

The main feature of this project is the ability for the player to change the type of the grid. This means that triangular grid can be transitioned to square or hexagonal grid and vice versa. 

With this feature in mind, a multiplayer snake game has been chosen to "implement" it. Currently, it is not a finished product and still needs further development.
